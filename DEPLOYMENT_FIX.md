# Streamlit Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed
1. **scikit-learn 1.3.2 not compatible with Python 3.13** - RESOLVED ✅
2. **Missing pymongo dependency** - RESOLVED ✅
3. **MongoDB connection failing on Streamlit Cloud** - RESOLVED ✅

## Solutions Applied
1. **Updated requirements.txt** with compatible package versions
2. **Added runtime.txt** to specify Python 3.11 (more stable for scikit-learn)
3. **Created .streamlit/config.toml** for proper configuration
4. **Added requirements_alt.txt** as backup with more conservative versions
5. **Made MongoDB optional** in core.py to handle deployment environments without MongoDB
6. **Added pymongo dependency** to requirements.txt

## Files Modified/Created
- `requirements.txt` - Updated package versions and added pymongo
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `requirements_alt.txt` - Alternative requirements file
- `core.py` - Made MongoDB connection optional with error handling

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Push to your GitHub repository
3. Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud
4. If it still fails, try renaming `requirements_alt.txt` to `requirements.txt`

## Key Changes
- scikit-learn: 1.3.2 → >=1.5.0,<2.0.0 (or use alt file with 1.3.0-1.4.2)
- streamlit: 1.32.2 → >=1.39.0,<2.0.0
- Added Python 3.11 specification
- Made version ranges more flexible
- **Added pymongo>=4.6.0**
- **Made MongoDB connection optional for cloud deployment**

## MongoDB Handling
The app now gracefully handles MongoDB unavailability:
- Skills assessment still works without database storage
- No crash when MongoDB is not available
- Prints informative error messages to logs

## Testing Locally
Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
